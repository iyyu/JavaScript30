# JavaScript30
Completed solutions for the [JavaScript 30 Day Challenge](https://JavaScript30.com).

## High Level Goals

- The first goal for me was to have fun playing with pure vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.
- The second goal for me was to add another thing to make it my own---another element with new functionality, build on top of the basic functionality, different styling, etc. 
## Navigation
- index-EXAMPLE.html is the example of the finished exercise graciously provided by [wesbos](https://github.com/wesbos). Most of the HTML/CSS/static assets were provided.
- index.html is my take.
